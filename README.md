☐ <https://ngpadovan.github.io/casinoWar/>: Casino War : War is a card game in which each card has a value or rank of 2-14 and whoever has the highest car wins. CasinoWar is the same concept, however, the player is able to make a wager that they will have have a higher rank card than the dealer. The cards are randomly pulled from a standard 52 card deck that resets after a new round of wagers begins. There is a balance feature that starts at 0 and keeps track of the players net wins and losses.
